  <!-- The <EMBED> element is wrapped inside a <DIV>, which has both a 'load'
  and a 'message' event listener attached.  This wrapping method is used
  instead of attaching the event listeners directly to the <EMBED> element to
  ensure that the listeners are active before the NaCl module 'load' event
  fires.  This also allows you to use PPB_Messaging.PostMessage() (in C) or
  pp::Instance.PostMessage() (in C++) from within the initialization code in
  your NaCl module. 
  
  The src points to a manifest file, which provides the Native Client plug-in
  a mapping between architecture and NaCl Executable (NEXE). 
  
  We use a non-zero sized embed to give Chrome space to place the bad plug-in
  graphic, if there is a problem.
